				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>
					Hi I'm a <b>Computer Science</b> student at <b>Griffith University</b> in my 
					first year with a particular focus on algorithms and data structures. I am a 
					avid user of open-source software and hope to be able to contribute to the 
					wider open-source community as I build my skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am from a photography, finance and customer service background and I hope 
					to be able to incorporate these into my future projects. I am particularly 
					interested in <b>UX Design</b>. UX Design has always been important to software design
					and yet is often overlooked as a career pathway.

				<h2>Skills</h2>
				<p>
					I am a <b>Creative</b> person who can think outside the box to solve complex
					problems. I am capable of solving <b>Hard</b> LeetCode problems using algorithms 
					and languages I have learnt throughout my degree such as <b>Python</b> and often
					challenge myself to perform further. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I also have proven <b>Leadership</b> skills within my workplace as a team leader
					having led a team of 10 team members. Providing support, leadership, coaching and
					mentorship to each member so they are able to perform at their best.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am <b>Adaptable</b> and have worked in many different industries from commerical 
					kitchens to taking inbound calls in call centers and teaching within the classroom. 
					My background in Education, Hospitality and Finance make me the very representation 
					of a <b>jack-of-all-trades</b>. This knowledge and adaptability can help show 
					different viewpoints.

				<h2>Experiences</h2>
				<p>
					I have had a long and extensive experience in many fields and as what was mentioned
					in the industry panel hosted at Griffith University, it was said that skills from
					experiences and interests in the past can be transferrable and are definitely 
					desirable in the industry.
